## Video Clip Retrieval
### A IS4200/CS6200 Project

This project explored possibilities of video retrieval by 2 models:

- Naive Bayes text-based search model, using query likelihood to rank the retrieved videos.
- ResNet content-based search model, powered by ResNet, with frame-by-frame video classification, and use cosine similarity to rank the retrieved videos.
